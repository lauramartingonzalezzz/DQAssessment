## Data Quality Assessment 
Data Quality Assessment is a repository that contains the source code developed in the article [1], as well as the dataset used.

This repository comprises 9 files and 3 folders:
- *AI-enabled_data_quality_improvement_techniques.ipynb* is a Jupyter notebook presenting the improvement workflow of a raw dataset using domain knowledge and AI techniques.
- *DQ_dimensions_performance.py* is a Python script in charge of launching Monte Carlo simulations to obtain runtime performance when assessing the chosen quality dimensions.
- *main.m* is the Matlab script that is responsible for obtaining the performance metrics of the output results of the previous file.
- *DQ_dimensions_performance.ipynb* is a Jupyter notebook that depicts the performance of each quality dimension in terms of delay.
- *configuration_variables.py* is a Python script used as a configuration file.
- *basic_operations.py* is a Python script that comprises different base functions.
- *context_broker_api.py* is a Python script that defines the API requests needed to interact with the Context Broker.
- *requirements.txt* is the standard file listing the PyPI packages to be installed.
- *README.md* is this documentation.
- */raw_data* contains the dataset used prior to its assessment.
- */data* is an empty folder tree which will be filled in as the *AI-enabled_data_quality_improvement_techniques.ipynb* script is run.
- */simulations* is an empty folder tree which will contain a subfolder for each of the Monte Carlo simulations obtaining the delay in the quality dimensions processes (*DQ_dimensions_performance.py*). It also includes an empty subfolder named */median_values*, where some of the results of the Matlab script (*main.m*) will be stored for later use in the Jupyter notebook *DQ_dimensions_performance.ipynb*.
