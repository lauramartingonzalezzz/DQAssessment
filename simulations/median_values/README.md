*/simulations* is an empty folder tree which will contain a subfolder for each of the Monte Carlo simulations obtaining the delay in the quality dimensions processes (*DQ_dimensions_performance.py*). It also includes an empty subfolder named */median_values*, where some of the results of the Matlab script (*main.m*) will be stored for later use in the Jupyter notebook *DQ_dimensions_performance.ipynb*.
